/**
 * Stores a set of pixels in a component-based format.
 * The component-based format stores colors as follows:
 *
 * Byte 0: Alpha
 * Byte 1: Blue 
 * Byte 2: Green
 * Byte 3: Red
 *
 * This format is fast, compact, and ideal for software rendering.
 * It has the following key advantages:
 * - Entire images can be copied to the screen with a single call to
 * System.arrayCopy. (If the screen is not in ABGR pixel format, it requires
 * some conversion. However, the conversion is typically quick and simple).
 * - Per component operations, such as  lighting, can be performed cheaply without any 
 * pixel format converison.
 *
 * This class is primarily intended to be a high-performance image storing 
 * facility for software rendering. As such, there are points where ease of 
 * use is compromised for the sake of performance. If you need to store and 
 * use images outside of a software renderer, it is recommended that you use 
 * Java's standard image classes instead.
